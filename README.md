# Network-Game-Template
This project is just a small project that I made after learning the basics of MonoGame and Lidgren to create a simple server-client based game.
The Visual Studio Solution has 3 projects, the client (NetworkingTestProject), the server (ServerApplication), and the Project Library (NetworkingTestProjectLibrary).
The code is a bit (very) messy, and has barely any comments.
This project was made mainly for myself to use, but is open to anyone (if you can even understand my code).
